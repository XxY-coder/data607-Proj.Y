# 1.How will I tackle the problem?

I will first split the variables, extracting name, region, total score, and pre-tournament rating. I will process B/H/U matches separately and calculate the average afterward. The output will consist of 5 columns and be exported as a CSV file.

# 2.What data challenges do I anticipate?

The main challenges are the presence of mixed B/H/U records within the match data.
